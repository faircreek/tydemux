#TyDemux

Old tool for demuxing tystreams, it was the core tool I coded.
Later on more developers joined coding a gui called TyStudio
around it.

Tydemux/Tystudio is still available at sourceforge, this is 
just a subset with the code that I was responsible for i.e. 
tydemux and tyserver. The latter was a embedded tool that
ran on the Tivo it self. 

Note I'm not maintaining TyDemux after all the coding I never
used tystudio/tydemux to make DVD's from Tivo recordings which
was the original reason why I started to code it. Guess it was
more fun coding and reverse engineering it than actually using 
it. It was also great to make something other Tivo fans could use.
