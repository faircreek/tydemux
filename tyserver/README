BUILD:

The build is more than messy at the time,

First do a cd to libs and exec:
make -f Makefile.tivo clean
make -f Makefile.tivo

Then do a cd ../tydemux and exec:
make -f Makefile.tivo clean
make -f Makefile.tivo

Then cd to tyserver and exec:
make clean
make

The tyserver and tyindex is now built and ready to use

Installation:

Ftp, tyserver, tyindex and show.tcl to the tivo place them in e.g. /var
NOTE: You have to ftp in binary mode!!! i.e.
ftp tivo

cd /var
bin
put tyserver
put tyindex
put show.tcl




Now telnet to the tivo and follow the instructions below:

cd /var
mkdir -p /var/index/index
mv show.tcl tyserver tyindex /var/index
chmod -R 777 index

cd index
./show.tcl


If the last command faild then it's more then 100% sure that you
have ^M:s in the file (Ctrl-M) due to the fact that you opened it
in Windows. Remove the Ctrl-M with your favorite dos2unix command/
coverter.

You are now ready to start the tyindex and tyserver
cd /var/index
./tyserver
./tyindex

They are daemons so they will background - NOTE: The current debug
version doesn't so you will need to telnet sessions to the TIVO and
start tyindex and tyserver in each of them.

NOTE: If you have a lot of recordings on your TIVO it can take a
very long time to index them all the fist time. Do a ls in /var/index
to see how many index files tyindex has created. NOTE: Please allow
around 15 to 30 min for tyindex to index a new recording!


Tyindex checks every 15min if it need to remove or add a index to the
index cache. If so it will start a new index creation session and then
again check (after 15min) if there is any to remove or add.


Tyserver - tyserver is listing to port 1150 and will accept the commands
listed below:

	Commands are single lines ending in \r\n.

	LITY\r\n 	list recordings
	OPTY nnnn\r\n	open fsid nnnn
	COTY\r\n	close fsid
	SCTY nnnn\r\n	send chunk nnnn
	CITY\r\n	create index
	GITY nnnn\r\n	Get mpeg I-Frame nnnn
	GSTY\r\n	Get SEQ header
	PLTY\r\n	Send all chunks in fsid
	EXIT		Exit and close server

	Server response:
	200 XXXXX - info of some sort
	300 X.... - data will be sent on the next line
	    0 == unknown about other wise stated amout of
	    data in bytes.
	400 XXXXX  - error and error string

---------------------------

LITY, will send you all recordings present on the tivo that you can
edit or download remotly. You will need to exec this command at fist
contact since the infomation is vital for further operation.

An example output can look like below:
200 Showdata

[snip]

The information after the 300 line can be parsed with the
parse_nowshowinig func in fsid.c

What you at a minimum need is the RecObjFsid@ 1674323
You will use this number to open the fsid/tystream with
help of OPTY.

---------------------------

OPTY nnnn\r\n will open a RecObjFsid@ number that you have
collected with LITY - NOTE that you can't closed
the connection between a LITY and an OPTY. The server
will free the fsid information that it hold and you
have to start over again!

When open a fsid the server will give you the vital
probe infromation back so you can adjust e.g. tydemux
to do the right type of demuxing of the stream that
you are about to recive.

200 Probing stream
200 Probing finished
200 Start chunk: 0

As you can see it's a DTIVO series 1 recoding with MPEG Layer II
audio - further more the Audi frame size is 576 and the number
of ticks each audio frame will play is 2160. The frame rate
is 29.97 f/s (4 - see mpeg specs). The total number of chunks
avalible in the stream is 10170. Please see functions in probe.c
in tydemux how to interpet and store this data.

---------------------------

COTY will close the fsid that you have currently open NOTE! It
will not close the connection and you can open another fsid after
you have closed the one that you have open.

---------------------------

SCTY nnnn will send chunk nnnn fron the currently open fsid
example output

200 Ok, here is the chunk
300 131072
"Chunk data"

---------------------------

CITY will create a index of a open fsid, you will need to use this
function if you want to do remote editing of the stream. Example
output

200: Printing index

300: 0
NumberOfEntries@ 6318

[snip]


Please use parse_gop_index func to parse the data after the
300 entry - it will create a gop index that you can use
for your remote editing needs.

---------------------------

GITY nnnn, will send you a mpeg encoded I-Frame from gop-index nnnn
in the file you have open !!NOTE: We start the counting of GOP
indexes on 1 not 0 as otherwise usuall in C/C++!!!!!!
example output

200 Ok, here is the I-Frame
300 28764
"I-Frame data"

---------------------------

GSTY will send a mpeg sequence header from the currenlty open fsid
example output
200 Ok, here is the SEQ header
300 3400
"SEQ data"

---------------------------

PLTY will send all chunks from a open fsid as one big stream!
example output
200 Ok, here is the stream
300 0
"stream data"

---------------------------

EXIT will close the server connection.

---------------------------

NOTE: It's very important that you close the file and 
that you close the server connection we will leek mem
otherwise!!!

NOTE: If you don't have a cached index or fsid info
those operations will take a long time. Especiall
the CITY that can take up to 10 min!!!!! Hence
make sure that you have tyindex running!!!
