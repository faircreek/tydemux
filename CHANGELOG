	Initial checkin of tydemux - it's based on tydemux 0.4.1
	Initial checkin of tychopper
	Initial checkin of tytranscode

2003-02-01 Olaf Beck <olaf_sc@yahoo.com>
	All files in tydemux/*

	Merged fixes from 0.4.3
	
	Prepared main loop for threading
	We now have get_chunk, get_pes_holders, tystream_init,
	repair_tystream, check_fix_pes_holder_video and
	write_pes_holders running basically independent of
	each other. Next step is to make them signal
	each other when to stop, halt and when we are 
	finished and move main chunk counting so 
	we can have while(1) loops.

	Added libs/dali 
	Added toplevel Makefile

	dali is decoding mpeg I frame
	for our indexing
	dali is also encoding our
	decoded mpeg images to 
	ppm images 

	Warning there is still bugs
	in the mpeg lib - the 
	worst once are fixed but need
	more time to debug it fully

	new funcs in index_edit 
	get_image will return
	a ppm image if you
	five it a gop_index

	Threadlib:
	Stats maintained on number of bytes read and written to the pipes
	in preparation for some sort of combined progress indicator.
	
	New program: typrocess 
	This is the controlling process that creates the pipes between
	the modules and starts the modules up as threads.
	Currently both mplex and transcode have been ported to this
	environment and have been built and tested under windows.

	VC6 project files have been updated to standardise the build
	directory names:

	New project files have been added to build threadlib, tymplex and
	tytranscode as libraries

	Changes to tytranscode:
	Ability to build as a library or as a stand-alone program main()
	has been moved to a separate file which is not included in the library
	version. Input and output stream functions re-written to use pipes.
	I have implemented a circular buffer on the input stream which is
	topped up from the pipe when it runs out of bytes. There were lots
	of associated changes elsewhere in the code.

	Mjpeg:
	I have removed all the mjpeg files and replaced them with a single 
	.zip file containing the mjpeg tree. Unzip this file at the same
	level as dvd_create.

2003-02-16 John Barrett <johnbarretthcc@hotmail.com>
	New common logging library added.
	typrocess, tymplex and tytranscode switched to use the logging library
	-pipe command added to typrocess
