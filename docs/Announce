The TyStudio team is proud to announce TyStudio v 0.5.0! TyStudio is a
set of tools whose purpose is to allow one to easily and painlessly
extract video streams from any tivo, and convert them to perfectly
legal, industry standard video formats. Other features include editing
video without having to extract it first, and automatic conversion of
the audio format to be DVD and VCD compliant as desired.

TyStudio, and all of its components and libraries, are available for 
free under the GPL license. You can obtain every component of TyStudio,
including the sources, from www.sourceforge.net/projects/dvd-create.

Please note that this initial release is to be considered beta software.
That said, there are a few things to be noted about this release:

- Currently there is no series 2 tivo support, although it is planned to
  come soon, we do not have any dev'ers who own these units to do the
  porting.
  
- There are known issues with audio sync when converting the audio to
  44.1khz. This is being worked on, and its a high priority.
  
- Tystreams extracted with jdiners tytool have a bug in them that
  prevents the tydemux component from reading them correctly. It's known
  how to fix it, but it's not currently one of our priorities.
  
- No frame accurate editing. It will come with time, but it's not 
  currently a priority. Meanwhile you can use non re-encoding frame
  accurate software such as womble mpeg-vcr instead.
