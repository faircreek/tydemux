TyProcess:

TyProcess is used to convert TySteam files to an MPEG program stream. TyProcess is essentially
a wrapper for: TyDemux, TyTranscode, and TyMplex. TyEditor is using the library part of
TyProcess, so TyProcess is more or less TyEditor without a GUI.

You will need to read the documentation for TyDemux, TyTranscode and TyMplex before you
start using TyProcess, as you will need to invoke switches for those programs through TyProcess.

To get a list of all of the available command line arguments, simply run tytranscode with no
parameters. The current commands/options at this time are listed below:


Current commands are:

	-mplex [{ mplex params }]	Sends commands to TyMplex.
	
	-tcode [{ transcode params }]	Sends commands to TyTranscode
	
	-demux [{ demux params }]	Sends commands to TyDemux

NOTE: There is a space between { and the first/last char in the parameter.

Current options are:

	-d <loglevel>		Sets the logging level. Default is X
	
	-l <logfile>		Log to a file. By default, all logging goes to stderr.
	
	-la <logfile> 		Same as above, except the log file is appended to the previous
				log instead of being overwritten.
	
	-pipe			Input and output from pipes, implies -demux and -mplex.
	
	-i <infile>		Tystream file that you want to read from.
	
	-o <outfile>		MPEG file that you want to create.

	-ia <input audio file>	Filename of the audio elementary stream (e.g. .mp2) that you want
				to read from.

	-iv <input video file>	Filename of the video elementary stream (e.g. .mpv) that you want
				to read from.
	
	-oa <output audio file>	Filename of the audio elementary stream that you want to create.
	
	-ov <output video file>	Filename of the video elementary stream that you want to create.
	
	-om <output mpeg file>	Filename of the MPEG stream that you want to create.

Examples how to invoke TyProcess:

typrocess -i infile.ty -o outfile.mpg  -mplex { -f 3 } -demux

This will covert a TyStream to a standard MPEG program stream that will be playable in any
MPEG player.

typrocess -i infile.ty -o outfile.mpg  -mplex { -f 8 } -demux

This will covert a TyStream to a DVD compliant MPEG program stream that will be playable in most
DVD players. NOTE: The packets for DVD information are currently empty. You will need to use
something like DVDauthor in order to turn this into something you can burn to a DVD.

typrocess -i infile.ty -o outfile.mpg  -mplex { -f 4 } -demux

This will covert a TyStream to an SVCD compliant MPEG program stream that will be playable in any
SVCD player.

typrocess -i infile.ty -o outfile.mpg  -mplex { -f 8 } -demux -tcode { -s 48000 -a }

This will covert a TyStream to a DVD compliant MPEG program stream that will be playable in most DVD
players. The audio channel will also be converted to 48kHz AC3 (Dolby Digital Sound) NOTE: The packets
for DVD information are currently empty. You will need to use something like DVDauthor in order to turn
this into something you can burn to a DVD.

typrocess -i infile.ty -o outfile.mpg  -mplex { -f 8 } -demux { -c mycutfile.cut } -tcode { -s 48000 -a }

This will covert a TyStream to a DVD compliant MPEG program stream that will be playable in most DVD
players. The audio channel will also be converted to 48kHz AC3 (Dolby Digital Sound). The TyStream will
also be cut according to the information carried in the file mycutfile.cut that you previously created
with TyEditor. NOTE: The packets for DVD information are currently empty. You will need to use something
like DVDauthor to turn this into something you can burn to a DVD.
