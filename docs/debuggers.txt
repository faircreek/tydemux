These tools will allow you to extract and debug tystreams without having to actualy
run TyStudio.

    - TyLS: This program will give a listing of what is currently on your tivo.
        You must have TyServer currently running on your tivo for this to work.
       
        You can use TyLS as follows:
       
        tyls -t <tivo ip address>
    
    - TyGet: This program will retrieve a tystream from your tivo based on an FSID that
        is given to you by TyLS. Like TyLS, TyServer must be running on your tivo
        for this to work.
        
        You can use TyGet as follows:
        
        tyget -t <tivo ip address> -o <filename to download to> -f <FSID from tyls>
    
    - TyChopper: This useful little tool allows you to cut up portions of a tystream
        in order to only send the bad portions of it (instead of the whole ensalada) to
        the authors for debugging so that they can fix the problem that your stream has in
        a future release.

        Although chunk numbers are passed as parameters, the chopping is not precise enough
        to guarantee that the chop will happen at that chunk. In particular, any header
        information in the .ty file will throw things off. Therefore, chop well before and
        after the suspect part of the stream.
        
        Usage of TyChopper:
        
        tychopper <input filename> <start chunk> <end chunk> <output filename>
